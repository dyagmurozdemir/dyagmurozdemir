## 1. Novelty in Restaurant Reviews: The Impact on Businesses and Consumers

Dicle Yagmur Ozdemir, Harpreet Singh, Sumit Sarkar

Abstract: The popularity of electronic word-of-mouth has increased dramatically over the
years, and platforms are attracting more and more consumers to read online reviews. Consequently,
it has become important to understand the various ways in which online reviews
impact relevant stakeholders such as platforms, businesses, and consumers. While prior works
have examined the impact of different review characteristics, the impact of new information
provided in reviews (review novelty) has not received attention. We study how review novelty
impacts different stakeholders. To do this, we use a dataset from Yelp that provides reviews and
other related information for restaurants. We examine how novel content in reviews influences
consumers’ restaurant check-ins and their perceptions of review helpfulness. We show that
restaurants with more novel reviews have more consumer check-ins. Interestingly, the impact
of review novelty on check-ins decreases if the novelty becomes too high. We also show that
consumers find novel information in online reviews helpful, as demonstrated by the number of
useful votes received by such reviews. This helps to explain the mechanism behind our findings
by providing evidence for both the direct and indirect effects of review novelty on the number
of check-ins. We also find that the impact of novel reviews on restaurant check-ins is higher for
high-priced restaurants. A fine-grained analysis examining novelty in the three aspects food,
service, and ambiance, shows that novelty in each aspect increases check-ins, with the impact
even higher for high-priced restaurants for the food and service aspects.


## 2. Tell Me Something New: Selecting Novel Online Reviews

Dicle Yagmur Ozdemir

Abstract: Reviews can help consumers decrease the uncertainty regarding the quality of
a product or service. However, reading reviews can become time-consuming if there exists a
large number of reviews for each product. To decrease the time a reader spends reading enough
reviews to make a decision, platforms can identify a subset of informative reviews to present to
the reader. Such a subset can help the consumer obtain as much new information as possible in
a short time. The goal of this study is to identify a subset of reviews that maximizes the novel
information offered to a reader. To solve this problem, a novelty formulation for a review set
is presented, and a relevant class of novelty measures is identified. The problem is difficult to
solve, and efficient heuristics exploiting the structure of the problem are proposed. Experiments
are conducted on restaurant reviews from Yelp to examine the effectiveness of the proposed
methods. The results show that the heuristics identify review sets with high amounts of novel
information in a computationally efficient way. Heuristics designed for real-time environments
are shown to be very scalable while still generating excellent solutions. We also show the
proposed approaches can be extended to scenarios preserving the average opinion and aspect
coverage in a corpus.

## 3. Credibility, Novelty, and Helpfulness in Online Reviews

Dicle Yagmur Ozdemir, Harpreet Singh, Sumit Sarkar

Abstract: User-generated contents such as reviews and ratings are very important for online
platforms. To better leverage such content, platforms enable users to vote on the helpfulness of
reviews. The importance of helpful votes (received by a review) to the platforms, consumers,
and reviewers, is substantive. Factors found to impact the helpfulness of a review include,
among others, the novelty of the content in the review and the review’s credibility characteristics
(i.e., source credibility and rating credibility). To better understand how consumers’
perceptions of review helpfulness are affected by these factors, we investigate the moderating
impact of credibility on the influence of review novelty on helpfulness. We find that source
credibility and review novelty are substitutes in terms of their contribution to review helpfulness.
On the other hand, rating credibility positively moderates the effect of a review’s novelty
on its helpfulness and complements review novelty. These findings are very important for the
different stakeholders. Platforms would benefit by knowing in a more nuanced manner what
is driving helpful votes. This should help them refine their procedures for recognizing elite contributors. From a reviewer’s perspective, a better understanding of these interactions can
help them craft reviews that are more likely to receive helpful votes.

## 4. Axiomatic Characterization of Novelty for Textual Content

Dicle Yagmur Ozdemir, Sumit Sarkar

Abstract: With the rapid increase in digitization, detecting novelty in textual content has
become important in many applications. A variety of computational techniques have been
developed for this purpose, typically tailored to the context of interest. While these approaches
have been shown to work well in their specific contexts, they have been developed using many
diverse methodological underpinnings. As a result, there is no consistent underlying conceptual
framework applicable to the various methods presented in the literature. The goal of this work
is to identify specific requirements that are desirable for novelty measures. We first state
assumptions that help characterize the objects (i.e., textual contents or documents) of interest.
We then identify a set of axioms for such objects, providing intuitive justifications for them.
Existing approaches typically satisfy only a subset of the axioms. To obtain additional insights
regarding how the measures may perform for different tasks, we conduct a set of experiments.
The experiments compare the performance of some of the commonly used novelty measures.
The axioms and the experimental findings can help researchers identify appropriate measures
for their task. Importantly, the axioms should also help develop new measures for specific
applications.

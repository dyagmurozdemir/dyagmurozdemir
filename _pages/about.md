I am an Assistant Professor of Business Information Management at the [Rotterdam School of Management](https://www.rsm.nl/), [Erasmus University](https://www.eur.nl/en). I hold a PhD in Management Science with a concentration in Information Systems from [University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/), a Master of Science in Industrial Engineering from [Sabanci University](https://ie.sabanciuniv.edu/), and a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering from [Istanbul Technical University](https://end.itu.edu.tr/en).

My current research examines issues related to user-generated content on online platforms. I am interested in understanding how novel information in user-generated content can be incorporated by different stakeholders into their decisions/actions by examining and designing the information flow in online settings. In one line of work, I use econometric modeling and natural language processing to examine and quantify how user-generated content influences platforms, businesses, content creators, and consumers. In another line of work, I focus on designing algorithms for online content selection to overcome consumersâ€™ information overload.
